Below is a list of tools I used while creating the application:

Below is a list of tutorials and resources I found helpful while creating the application:

* Sahil Diwan's [Making a Flask app using a PostgreSQL database and deploying to Heroku](http://blog.sahildiwan.com/posts/flask-and-postgresql-app-deployed-on-heroku/)
* Yuval Adam's [Flask and PostgreSQL on Heroku](http://blog.y3xz.com/blog/2012/08/16/flask-and-postgresql-on-heroku)

Additionally, Google, StackOverflow and the Angular.js documentation were incredibly helpful.
