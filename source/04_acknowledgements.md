The models used in this tool were introduced Mohammad M. Ghassemi, Stefan E. Richter, Ifeoma M. Eche, Tszyi W. Chen, John Danziger, and Leo A. Celi in their paper *A data-driven approach to optimized medication dosing: a focus on heparin*. This project would not have been possible without Mohammadâ€™s support.

Additionally, data used in these models was sourced from the MIMIC-II and MIMIC-III (@MIMICII) medical databases, a project supported by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology.

I also have many advisors who helped me with this project:

- Mohammad M. Ghassemi 
- [Sri Kurniawan](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~srikur/) 
- [Matthew Guthaus](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~mrg/) 

Additionally the following people were very influential in preparing me for this project:

- [James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/) 
- [Phokion Kolaitis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kolaitis/) 
- [Philip Strong](http://www.pamf.org/dr-philip-strong.html) 
<!-- - [Leo Celi](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/display/person/58103)  -->
<!-- maybe add Kenneth Paik / Sana -->

Finally, this project would not have been possible without the unwavering moral and technical support of my parents Howard Rowley and Carol Diamond.
