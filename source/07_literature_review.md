# Literature Review

<!--
After the introductory chapter, it seems fairly common to 
include a chapter that reviews the literature and 
introduces methodology used throughout the thesis.

## Traditional Dosing

Explain what heparin is, how heparin is traditional prescribed.  
reference dosage guidelines which are in the appendix. 

## High Level

At a high level explain what we want to do - remove doctors manual process/guessing heuristics.  
we want to predict the amount of heparin needed to get a therapeutic aptt. explain aptt is our marker for success. explain that there is a lot of data that can be used for predictions - explain how they selected their features.  

## Prediction 

explain different techniques that could be used (svm, logistic regression, others listed in their paper)  
then explain that mohammad et al chose to use logistic regression because it had a natural relationship with this...  

### Logistic Regression 

explain what logistic regression is and how they used the multiparameter model.  
explain how they choose features for the model.  
explain equation 1.

(@ref_for_eqn1) $P(thera) = P(sub) + P(supra)$

## Summary of their results 

Summary of the results from their paper.  It is better than weight based system alone.  
They weren't able to test if it was better than an actual doctor because you'd need to have the system in place to do that. That is where this system/survey comes into play.
