# Introduction

<!-- ## Background -->

Explain how I reimplemented a research paper into a real world web application and then tested it. 

- keep it relatively high level  
- current dosing practices 
- how retrospective data comes into play, potential improvements it offers. Increasing patient care outcomes. Cost/length of stay outcomes. Could revolutionize the ways in which drug trails occur. Drug trails traditionally use a rather homogeneous group of people, and test them to with doses to see if there are any adverse effects. After we test with the homogeneous group, the guidelines developed are used for patients that do not fit in with the testing cohort, so no guidelines for proper dosing exist for these patients. 
- purpose of thesis, demonstrate a potential interface for an actual model that has been peered reviewed gather insights on potential issues with dosing. Also create a sample web application that works for this use case, so that the technique can be more easily generalized to other drugs such as ....????
