# Calculator Explanation


<!-- ## Introduction -->

This project is composed of two key components. The first is a "dose calculator" which contains all the needed components to determine the optimal dose for a given patient. The second component is a survey that incorporates the calculator and is used to study how doctors interact with the dosing tool. We will now describe the calculator.

## Functional Requirements 
The purpose of the calculator is to determine the functions for the probability of sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, supra-therapeutic for a range of infusion amounts for a given patient. This functionality required some key steps:
1. Access Data and filter it. 
2. Calculate Static Models
3. Make a prediction based on a given patient's features.   
<!-- explain what it is - a standalone calculator, to familiar doctors with the technique.  -->
<!-- Goals of System   -->
<!-- - mobile ready...  -->
<!-- talk about user experience/ui design. -->

## Architecture 

<!-- architecture here... include a figure.F igure \ref{ref_a_figure} shows how to add a figure. Donec ut lacinia nibh. Nam tincidunt augue et tristique cursus. Vestibulum sagittis odio nisl, a malesuada turpis blandit quis. Cras ultrices metus tempor laoreet sodales. Nam molestie ipsum ac imperdiet laoreet. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. -->

## Implementation 

<!-- talk about the stack, tools used etc.  -->
<!-- talk about how the tools used helped ensure rapid prototyping and good ui.  -->
