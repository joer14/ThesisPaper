Participant & ICU Experience \\ \hline
1 & I have served as a consultant in the PICU for 30 years \\ \hline
2 & Surgery internship: vascular surgery patients - 2 mos \\ \hline
3 & About 10 months of ICU during training - mixture of medical, surgical, and cardiac \\ \hline
4 & In residency training x 7 years and as faculty x 9.5 years \\ \hline
5 & Approximately 1 to 5 patients per month in ICU. \\ \hline
6 & Residency (3 month long rotations), Fellowship (3 years), Attending (13 years) \\ \hline
7 & I have bimonthly rotations there \\
8 & No \\ \hline

\caption{Post Survey Responses Question 1 and Question 2}
\label{my-label}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|l|X|}
\hline
 & Q1 & Question 2 \\ \hline
1 & More & need a bit more data about renal function and overall status \\ \hline
2 & More & You are stepping out of the realm of current standard practice. You are relying on 1) the data used in the model reflecting the patient group seen in your practice, 2) the statistical methods used being the most appropriate. \\ \hline
3 & More & A bit of a 'black box' - I would want to see more about validation before fully implementing \\ \hline
4 & Equally & would like to know more about the stats and the mechanisms that are responsible for the predictions \\ \hline
5 & More & Lack of prospective trial using this method to provide validation of this tool \\
6 & More & Still have to take in consideration other complications with regard to thrombus formation, bleeding risk, clearance (renal injury), other coagulation factors, etc. \\
7 & More & The fractions in calculation makes hard to adminster we could round up for example 18.2 to 18 that way it would be more applicable \\ \hline
8 & More & None \\ \hline
9 & More & None; very helpful \\ \hline

\caption{Post Survey Responses Question 3}
\label{my-label}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
Participant & Question 3 \\ \hline
1 & yes - in the ICU \\ \hline
2 & Potentially this could be a great tool for patients on multiple drugs simultaneously - are there models that will help predict more accurately what type of dose adjustments should be made for patients on multiple heart failure meds e.g. \\ \hline
3 & Other pharmaceuticals, e.g. antibiotics requiring levels (Vancomycin, Gentamycin, etc) \\ \hline
4 & medical care of patients in general particularly for blood sugar, pain control \& sedation, etc. \\ \hline
5 & Warfarin dosing? \\ \hline
6 & I think it would be helpful in the ICU as a guide. \\ \hline
7 & Yes. Specially in fluid management in shock patients \\ \hline
8 & protocolizeed approaches. \\ \hline
9 & Treatment for PE, acute extremity thrombosis, stroke \\ \hline

\caption{Post Survey Responses Question 4}
\label{my-label}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
Participant & Question 3 \\ \hline
2 & It would be interesting to know if the dosing model works the same, or similarly among different patient groups (race, sex, BMI etc) and if not are there ways to adapt for these factors.,The dosing tool model is an excellent idea. \\ \hline
8 & Create your own web page where people can go and use....similar to Angiocalc.com \\ \hline
9 & Would be good to get one more feedback calculation after adjusted the dose for a confirmation since I made mistakes by a factor of 10 \\ \hline
