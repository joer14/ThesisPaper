# Conclusion

<!--
After the introductory chapter, it seems fairly common to 
include a chapter that reviews the literature and 
introduces methodology used throughout the thesis.

<!-- Participants adjusted their doses 72% of time after reviewing the model, which resulted in a higher probability of therapeutic outcome in 82% of the adjustments. Additionally, participants reported greater confidence when using the tool but also expressed some hesitation with adopting the tool, often due to a lack of understanding of the underlying models. More information follows. Access to the extended survey results can be found in [Appendix 1](#appendix-1-full-survey-results). -->
The central focus of this study was to implement an interactive data-driven dosage tool and test its usability with medical doctors. While doing this we learned about domain specific, technical, and usability challenges. The goal of our work was to provide sufficient information such that a new version could be built and tested in a formal clinical setting. While the majority of participants felt more confident prescribing heparin using the tool, they also overwhelming expressed a need for a greater understanding of the underlying models making the predictions. This speaks to a usability problem that will be addressed in future versions by creating a more interactive, learning based tool. The future architecture presented will also open the door to dosing other drugs and trying out other models beyond logistic regression. These techniques will provide personalized insight in complex cases involving unique patient cohorts. Without question, in time the computer's roll in prescribing drugs will grow, leading to improved quality of care for patients while decreasing hospital stay times and the cost of care.
