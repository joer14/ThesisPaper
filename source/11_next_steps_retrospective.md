# Retrospective / Next Steps 

<!--
After the introductory chapter, it seems fairly common to 
include a chapter that reviews the literature and 
introduces methodology used throughout the thesis.

## Shortcomings in the Survey

- errors  
- lack of data
- better explanation of how the model/logistic regression works. explain what features are being used in the prediction and what aren't. suggest a potential user interface that gives weights to things e.g. The patients suggested dose deviates from a baseline dose curve due to the patients ethnicity and creatinine and mean SOFA scores. 

## Places for Future Research

how did the doses differ in part 1 and part 2 of the survey. 

## Implementation Differences in future version

- transfer model to device so it can do queries more quickly
- instead of static data source have real medical database
- easily interchangeable models
- better analytics
