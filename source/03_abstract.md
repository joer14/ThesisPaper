# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

The intention of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a statistical drug dosing tools in a mock clinical setting. We wanted to learn about both the technical implementation and user experience challenges involved with creating and using computer-aided dosing tools. First, a web application was developed using existing models for dosing heparin in ICU patients. This application was next developed into an interactive user survey. We found that doctors were generally more confident when dosing using the tools, but also expressed concerns about their understanding of the tool. In closing, we recommend some best practices for future development of statistical drug dosing tools.
