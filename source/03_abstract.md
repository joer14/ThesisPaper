# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

The intention of this study was to determine the feasibility of using statistical drug dosing tools in a mock clinical setting. We wanted to learn about both the technical implementation and user experience challenges involved with creating and using computer aided dosing tools. First a web application was developed using existing models for dosing heparin in ICU patients. This application was next developed into an interactive user survey. We found that Doctors were generally more confidant and faster when dosing using the tools. [[add other results here too. It's good to avoid numbers in abstracts from what I recall]] In closing we recommend some best practices for future development of statistical drug dosing tools.
