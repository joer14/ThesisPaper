<p>The models used in this tool were introduced Mohammad M. Ghassemi, Stefan E. Richter, Ifeoma M. Eche, Tszyi W. Chen, John Danziger, and Leo A. Celi in their paper A data-driven approach to optimized medication dosing: a focus on heparin <!-- [@ghassemi2014data] -->. This project would not have been possible without Mohammad’s support.</p>
<p>Additionally, data used in these models was sourced from the MIMIC-II and MIMIC-III (<span class="citation">Saeed et al. (2011)</span>) medical databases, a project supported by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology.</p>

<h1 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<!-- ## Background -->
<p>Explain how I reimplemented a research paper into a real world web application and then tested it.</p>
<ul>
<li>keep it relatively high level<br />
</li>
<li>current dosing practices</li>
<li>how retrospective data comes into play, potential improvements it offers. Increasing patient care outcomes. Cost/length of stay outcomes. Could revolutionize the ways in which drug trails occur. Drug trails traditionally use a rather homogeneous group of people, and test them to with doses to see if there are any adverse effects. After we test with the homogeneous group, the guidelines developed are used for patients that do not fit in with the testing cohort, so no guidelines for proper dosing exist for these patients.</li>
<li>purpose of thesis, demonstrate a potential interface for an actual model that has been peered reviewed gather insights on potential issues with dosing. Also create a sample web application that works for this use case, so that the technique can be more easily generalized to other drugs such as ....????</li>

<h2 id="traditional-dosing"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Traditional Dosing</h2>
<p>Explain what heparin is, how heparin is traditional prescribed.<br />
reference dosage guidelines which are in the appendix.</p>
<h2 id="high-level"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> High Level</h2>
<p>At a high level explain what we want to do - remove doctors manual process/guessing heuristics.<br />
we want to predict the amount of heparin needed to get a therapeutic aptt. explain aptt is our marker for success. explain that there is a lot of data that can be used for predictions - explain how they selected their features.</p>
<h2 id="prediction"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Prediction</h2>
<p>explain different techniques that could be used (svm, logistic regression, others listed in their paper)<br />
then explain that mohammad et al chose to use logistic regression because it had a natural relationship with this...</p>
<h3 id="logistic-regression"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Logistic Regression</h3>
<p>explain what logistic regression is and how they used the multiparameter model.<br />
explain how they choose features for the model.<br />
explain assumption of proportional odds-<br />
&gt; Ordinal logistic regression is a special form of multinomial logistic regression which is commonly used to model categorical outcomes with some meaningful order. Besides the assumption that outcomes can be ordered in a meaningful way, ordinal regression also makes the assumption of proportional odds. This assumption leads to regression coefficients that are maintained across classes, with only the intercept terms of the models changing. That is, it assumes that explanatory features maintain identical effects across varying ranges of the outcome. seem that modeling therapeutic aPTT categories would lend itself nicely to this kind of approach. However, we did not feel that the assumption of proportional odds was a valid one. Specifically, the constant nature of the regression coefficients enforces zero skew on the P(therapeutic) function, and thereby limits the flexibility of the approach.<br />
thereby limits the flexibility of the approach. explain equation 1.</p>

<p>Summary of the results from their paper. It is better than weight based system alone.<br />
They weren't able to test if it was better than an actual doctor because you'd need to have the system in place to do that. That is where this system/survey comes into play.</p>

<p>
In this study you are asked to determine the appropriate dose of heparin to prescribe to patients admitted to your fictional ICU. Your task is to choose an initial infusion rate of heparin, which will achieve therapeutic PTT as measured in 6 hours time as quickly and accurately as possible. Therapeutic PTT is defined as between 60 and 100 seconds.
</p>
<p>
After you suggest an initial dose of heparin, a statistical model will display showing an estimated infusion rate which is believed to maximize the probability of a therapeutic outcome. The probability of a therapeutic outcome within 6 hours time is relatively rare, only occurring in roughly 30% of the 1,680 cases in the dataset.
<p>
Each patient’s chart will summarize their medical history and relevant laboratory data. Additionally, you will be provided your hospital’s heparin dosage guidelines which you can use to inform your decision. After prescribing the initial dose, another patient profile will be presented and this task repeats four more times.
</p>
<p>
If at any point you don’t understand a term, please refer to the glossary, which is always available at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>
Now, please read over the heparin dosage guidelines, then click the button begin Test 1.
</p>
<p>
These guidelines will be accessible when you need them later, so there is no need to copy them down.

<ul>
<li>errors<br />

<li>lack of data</li>
<li>better explanation of how the model/logistic regression works. explain what features are being used in the prediction and what aren't. suggest a potential user interface that gives weights to things e.g. The patients suggested dose deviates from a baseline dose curve due to the patients ethnicity and creatinine and mean SOFA scores.</li>
