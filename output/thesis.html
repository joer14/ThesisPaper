Drug trails traditionally use a rather homogeneous group of people, and test them to with doses to see if there are any adverse effects. After we test with the homogeneous group, the guidelines developed are used for patients that do not fit in with the testing cohort, so no guidelines for proper dosing exist for these patients.

talk about what I did

 -->
<p>The primary goal of this study was to determine the technical implementation challenges and user experience challenges involved with a statistical dosing tool. Specifically, we implemented a heparin dosing tool that was first introduced in the paper <em>A data-driven approach to optimized medication dosing: a focus on heparin</em> <span class="citation">(Ghassemi et al. 2014)</span>. In the paper a statistical model is generated for predicting an optimal infusion rate for heparin for patients in intensive care units (ICUs). In this study, we reimplemented their existing models into an interactive web application, which allows the user to generate dosage guidelines based on a patient's features. Next a user study application was created, which presents the doctors with a patient case. The doctor initially provides their own suggestion for the infusion rate and is then presented with the model's prediction for an optimal infusion rate. After the doctor views the model, they have the opportunity to adjust their initial dose and provide a reasoning for their dose adjustments. Their interaction with the tool yields many metrics, including number of dose adjustments, speed of dosing, number of times guidelines were viewed.</p>
<!-- One serious disadvantage of heparin risk factor analyses based on clinical trials alone is that they exclude patients who exhibit a high propensity for bleeding or severe complications caused by bleeding [2]. Retrospec- tive analyses like ours are able to overcome this issue by utilizing clinical data that is reflective of the entire pop- ulation actually receiving treatment.  -->
<!-- Their final multiple feature model improved outcome classification over a weight-only with a volume under the surface (VUS) of 0.48 vs. 0.42. -->
<!-- Statistical dosing tools offer an alternative to traditional dosing methodologies, which by nature cannot be tuned to a specific patient's every condition every time. Additionally, traditional dosing often is backed by heuristics, knowledge accumulated overtime by more experienced doctors. This knowledge is not peer reviewed and cannot be easily transfered to other new doctors. The promise of statistical dosing is that it   -->

<h2 id="traditional-dosing-of-heparin"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Traditional Dosing of Heparin</h2>
<p>Heparin is an anticoagulant medication administered intravenously to patients with blood clots. Specifically it is often used for strokes, pulmonary embolism (blockage in an artery in the lung), acute coronary syndrome (e.g. heart attack), and many other conditions. The general protocol for dosing heparin is to initially order baseline lab results for the patient. These values combined with context of the patients condition allow a doctor to determine the infusion rate and if a bolus (a single large initial dose) is required. The primary metric used for monitoring patient progress is activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). After the infusion is started the patient is monitored and the dose is adjust periodically. Most often new labs are ordered every 6 hours [citation to UW and Beth Israel].</p>

<h2 id="predicting-therapeutic-outcome"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Predicting Therapeutic Outcome</h2>
<p>The objective of the dosing tool is determine an ideal initial infusion rate, such that patient has the highest probability of reaching a therapeutic state in 6 hours time. A therapeutic state is defined as an APTT value of between 60 seconds and 100 second. To predict an optimal dose Ghassemi et al. employed the use of multi-variant logistic regression.</p>
<h3 id="logistic-regression-approach"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Logistic Regression Approach</h3>
<!-- Logistic regression  -->
<p>The objective of the model was to determine the probability that patient would end in one of three categories: sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, or supra-therapeutic. A patient can by definition only be in one category at a time. This lead Ghassemi et al. to the following equation:<br />
(1) <span class="math inline">1 = <em>P</em>(<em>s</em><em>u</em><em>b</em> − <em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>p</em><em>e</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>c</em>)+<em>P</em>(<em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>p</em><em>e</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>c</em>)+<em>P</em>(<em>s</em><em>u</em><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>a</em> − <em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>p</em><em>e</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>c</em>)</span></p>
<p>The challenge of using logistic regression to predict therapeutic outcomes is that the probability of a therapeutic outcome is not a strictly monotonic function. So using logistic regression directly to predict P(therapeutic) will not work. That being said, the probability of sub-therapeutic and supra-therapeutic outcomes are monotonically decreasing and increasing functions respectively. Given these properties, we can use multinomial logistic regression to determine functions for sub-therapeutic and supra-therapeutic aPTT. Using equation 1 we can then determine the probability of a therapeutic outcome.<br />
Although at this point a case been has made that multinomial logistic regression may be an appropriate tool, there are a few considerations the Ghassemi et al. took with regards to the form of regression. There are many forms of multinomial logistic regression with subtle but important differences. There is a natural order to the classifications (sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, supra-therapeutic), so ordinal logistic regression could be considered. The challenge with ordinal logistic regression, however, is that it makes the assumption of proportional odds, so regression intercept terms vary across classes while regression coefficients are shared across classes. In the words of the original authors <em>&quot;it assumes that explanatory features maintain identical effects across varying ranges of the outcome&quot;</em>[citation appendix]. Instead the ordinal regression they instead used a modified version of standard multinomial logistic regression, which utilized a flexible reference category. That is instead of using a single class to predict the outcome that is not being modeled, they used all classes. So when modeling supra-therapeutic aPTT, standard multinomial logistic regression would reference either therapeutic or sub-therapeutic aPTT classes, while their approach referenced both classes. This choice was demonstrated to have significant effects on the validity of their models [citation to appendix, section 2].</p>

<h3 id="feature-selection"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Feature Selection</h3>
<p>There are innumerable potential features one could consider as predictors of patient outcome. In their paper, Ghassemi et al. determined the salient features as follows: age, SOFA score, Elixhauser, Heparin dose, Measurement time, Creatinine, Ethnicity, Gender, ICU type, presence of pulmonary embolism, obesity, presence of end stage renal failure.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-their-results"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Summary of Their Results</h2>
<p>The original paper and associated appendix document the efforts taken to validate the models. To summarize, they partitioned their dataset, dedicating 70% to training and 30% for validation. They then compared the calculated the predicted classification for each patient using both a full featured model and a weight-only model. The full featured model was more accurate than the weight-only approach as measured by Volume Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Surface (the multiple class version of Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), with values of 0.48 vs 0.42 [citation].<br />
In closing, they noted that a randomized controlled trial would be necessary to determine if this mechanism is more effective for dosing. This thesis project represents the initial steps towards this trial.</p>

<h1 id="calculator-explanation"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Calculator Explanation</h1>
<!-- ## Introduction -->
<p>This project is composed of two key components. The first is a &quot;dose calculator&quot; which contains all the needed components to determine the optimal dose for a given patient. The second component is a survey that incorporates the calculator and is used to study how doctors interact with the dosing tool. We will now describe the calculator.</p>
<h2 id="functional-requirements"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>The purpose of the calculator is to determine the functions for the probability of sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, supra-therapeutic for a range of infusion amounts for a given patient. This functionality required some key steps: 1. Access Data and filter it. 2. Calculate Static Models 3. Make a prediction based on a given patient's features.<br />
<!-- explain what it is - a standalone calculator, to familiar doctors with the technique.  --> <!-- Goals of System   --> <!-- - mobile ready...  --> <!-- talk about user experience/ui design. --></p>
