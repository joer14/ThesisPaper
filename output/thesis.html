<!-- ## Background -->
<!-- 
Explain how I reimplemented a research paper into a real world web application and then tested it. 

- keep it relatively high level  
- current dosing practices 
- how retrospective data comes into play, potential improvements it offers. Increasing patient care outcomes. Cost/length of stay outcomes. Could revolutionize the ways in which drug trails occur. Drug trails traditionally use a rather homogeneous group of people, and test them to with doses to see if there are any adverse effects. After we test with the homogeneous group, the guidelines developed are used for patients that do not fit in with the testing cohort, so no guidelines for proper dosing exist for these patients. 
- purpose of thesis, demonstrate a potential interface for an actual model that has been peered reviewed gather insights on potential issues with dosing. Also create a sample web application that works for this use case, so that the technique can be more easily generalized to other drugs such as ....????

 -->
<p>The primary goal of this study was to determine the technical implementation challenges and user experience challenges involved with using a statistical dosing tool in a clinical setting. Specifically, we implemented a heparin dosing tool that was first introduced in the paper <em>A data-driven approach to optimized medication dosing: a focus on heparin</em> <span class="citation">(Ghassemi et al. 2014)</span>. In the paper a statistical model is generated for predicting an optimal infusion rate of heparin for patients in intensive care units (ICUs). In this study, we reimplemented their existing models into an interactive web application, which allows the user to generate dosage guidelines based on a patient's features such as age, weight, and other lab results. Next a user study web application was created, which presents the doctors with a patient case. The doctor initially provides their own suggestion for the infusion rate and is then presented with the model's prediction for an optimal infusion rate. After the doctor views the model, they have the opportunity to adjust their initial dose and provide a reasoning for their dose adjustment. Their interaction with the tool yields many metrics, which when combined with their text based comments provides us insight into how they used the tool. What follows is a description of how we implemented the application, conducted the survey, and some proposed future areas for research.</p>
<!-- One serious disadvantage of heparin risk factor analyses based on clinical trials alone is that they exclude patients who exhibit a high propensity for bleeding or severe complications caused by bleeding [2]. Retrospec- tive analyses like ours are able to overcome this issue by utilizing clinical data that is reflective of the entire pop- ulation actually receiving treatment.  -->
<!-- Their final multiple feature model improved outcome classification over a weight-only with a volume under the surface (VUS) of 0.48 vs. 0.42. -->
<!-- Statistical dosing tools offer an alternative to traditional dosing methodologies, which by nature cannot be tuned to a specific patient's every condition every time. Additionally, traditional dosing often is backed by heuristics, knowledge accumulated overtime by more experienced doctors. This knowledge is not peer reviewed and cannot be easily transfered to other new doctors. The promise of statistical dosing is that it   -->

<h2 id="traditional-dosing-of-heparin"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Traditional Dosing of Heparin</h2>
<p>Heparin is an anticoagulant medication administered intravenously to patients with blood clots. Specifically, it is often used for strokes, pulmonary embolism (blockage in an artery in the lung), acute coronary syndrome (e.g. heart attack), and many other conditions. Each hospital has it's own set of protocols for how to dose heparin, but the general protocol for dosing heparin is to initially order baseline lab results for the patient. These values combined with context of the patients condition allow a doctor to determine the infusion rate and if a bolus (a single large initial dose) is required. The primary metric used for monitoring patient progress is activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). aPTT is medical test specifically used to determine how well blood is coagulating. It is measured in seconds, with a therapeutic range defined as between 60 and 100 <span class="citation">(Ghassemi et al. 2014)</span>. After the infusion is started the patient is monitored and the dose is adjusted periodically. Most often new labs are ordered every 6 hours <span class="citation">(Lisa Gryttenholm 2004)</span>, <span class="citation">(Washington Pharmacy Services 2014)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="predicting-therapeutic-outcome"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Predicting Therapeutic Outcome</h2>
<p>The objective of the dosing tool is determine an ideal initial infusion rate, such that a patient has the highest probability of reaching a therapeutic state in 6 hours time. A therapeutic state is defined as an aPTT value of between 60 seconds and 100 seconds. To predict an optimal dose Ghassemi et al. employed the use of a multi-variant logistic regression.</p>
<h3 id="logistic-regression-approach"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Logistic Regression Approach</h3>
<!-- Logistic regression  -->
<p>The objective of the model was to determine the probability that a patient would end in one of three categories: sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, or supra-therapeutic. A patient can by definition only be in one category at a time. This lead Ghassemi et al. to the following equation for describing the probability of being a given state:<br />

<p>The challenge of using logistic regression to predict therapeutic outcomes is that the probability of a therapeutic outcome is not a strictly monotonic function. So using logistic regression directly to predict P(therapeutic) will not work. That being said, the probability of sub-therapeutic and supra-therapeutic outcomes are monotonically decreasing and increasing functions, respectively. Given these properties, we can use multinomial logistic regression to determine functions for sub-therapeutic and supra-therapeutic aPTT. Using Equation 1 we can then determine the probability of a therapeutic outcome.<br />
At this point a case has been made that multinomial logistic regression may be an appropriate tool, but there are a few considerations that Ghassemi et al. took with regards to choosing the form of regression. There are many forms of multinomial logistic regression with subtle but important differences. There is a natural order to the classifications (sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, supra-therapeutic), so ordinal logistic regression could be considered. The challenge with ordinal logistic regression, however, is that it makes the assumption of proportional odds, so regression intercept terms vary across classes while regression coefficients are shared across classes. In the words of the original authors <em>&quot;it assumes that explanatory features maintain identical effects across varying ranges of the outcome.&quot;</em> Instead of the ordinal regression they used a modified version of standard multinomial logistic regression, which utilized a flexible reference category. That is instead of using a single class to predict the outcome that is not being modeled, they used all classes. So when modeling supra-therapeutic aPTT, standard multinomial logistic regression would reference either therapeutic or sub-therapeutic aPTT classes, while their approach referenced both classes. This choice was demonstrated to have significant effects on the validity of their models <span class="citation">(Ghassemi et al. 2014)</span>.</p>

<p>There are innumerable potential features one could consider as predictors of patient outcome. In their paper, Ghassemi et al. determined the salient features as follows: age, SOFA score, Elixhauser, Heparin dose, aPTT Measurement time, Creatinine, Ethnicity, Gender, ICU type, presence of pulmonary embolism, obesity, and presence of end stage renal failure.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-prior-work"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Summary of Prior Work</h2>
<p>The original paper and associated appendix document the efforts taken to validate their models. To summarize, they partitioned their dataset, dedicating 70% to training and 30% for validation. They then compared the predicted classification for each patient using both a full featured model and a weight-only model. The full featured model was more accurate than the weight-only approach as measured by Volume Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Surface (the multiple class version of Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), with values of 0.48 vs 0.42 <span class="citation">(Ferri et al. 2003)</span>. In closing, they noted that a randomized controlled trial would be necessary to determine if this mechanism is more effective for dosing than the traditional guidelines. This thesis project represents the initial steps towards this trial.</p>

<!-- ## Introduction -->
<p>This project is composed of two key components. The first is a &quot;dose calculator&quot; which contains all the functionality required to determine the optimal dose for a given patient. The second component is a survey that incorporates the calculator and is used to study how doctors interact with the dosing tool. We now describe the calculator.</p>
<!-- explain what it is - a standalone calculator, to familiar doctors with the technique.  -->

<h2 id="functional-requirements"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>The purpose of the calculator is to determine the probability functions for sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, supra-therapeutic aPTT for a range of infusion amounts for a given patient. The calculation can be broken into three steps:<br />
1. Access and refine the dataset.<br />
2. Calculate static models.<br />
3. Make a prediction based on a given patient's features.</p>
<h3 id="data-processing"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Data Processing</h3>
<p>The data source for the original study was the MIMIC II database. MIMIC is an open access database consisting of over 40,000 deidentified patient encounters from Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital's ICUs. It is hosted at MIT's Lab for Computational Physiology. The majority of patients in an ICU do not receive heparin, so filtering by medication was needed. This was accomplished by a series of SQL queries on a local machine. Furthermore, we worked to maintain an identical dataset as was used in the original dataset. This required filtering out all transfer patients and all patients missing required features. Additionally some features viz. Elixhauser comorbidity index, mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), required manual calculation on a per patient basis, as they were not available directly from MIMIC. This yielded a dataset of approximately 1,600 patients. This number varies depending on the features supplied for a given prediction.</p>
<p>This data munging was primarily done in Python using the Pandas library, but also required PostgreSQL for hosting the database. SQL queries were composed by hand. To prepare the data for model generation we needed to code several variables. Specifically, we needed to add binary classifiers for sub-therapeutic and supra-therapeutic aPTT to each patient's dataset. Additionally, a binary classifier was needed for ethnicity, and we followed the original coding used in the paper (white and non-white) <span class="citation">(Ghassemi et al. 2014)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="model-generation"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Model Generation</h3>
<p>Once the dataset was prepared, generating the models was fairly simple. We used the Python library Scikit-learn's <span class="citation">(Pedregosa et al. 2011)</span> implementation of multinomial Logistic Regression to compute the two logistic regressions. Once the two logistic regressions for sub-therapeutic and supra-therapeutic aPTT are generated they can be stored for later use as long as the dataset has not changed.</p>
<h3 id="model-prediction"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Model Prediction</h3>
<p>To generate the final dose curves for a specific patient, we use Scikit-learn's logistic regression predict_proba function . A function was created to output the probability of sub-therapeutic, sup-therapeutic aPTT given a patients features and a dose. For graphical purposes, we call this function repeatedly for varying infusion rates in the range of 0 to 34 units/Kg/HR in steps of 0.5 units/Kg/HR. Predicting the specific infusion rate which maximizes the probability of a therapeutic outcome can also be thought of as finding the point which minimizes the sum of the probabilities of sub-therapeutic and supra-therapeutic (see equation 1). Using this fact we used the Python library Scipy's minimize_scalar <span class="citation">(Jones et al. 2001)</span> function which implements Brent's Method <span class="citation">(Jones et al. 2015)</span> and let it solve for the highest probability with a tolerance of .01% . The infusion rate curves and the optimal dose are then cached in Postgres for future queries that match the same patient features, given that the initial dataset has not changed.</p>

<h2 id="survey-design"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Survey Design</h2>

<p>The primary objective of the survey was to learn about the user experience challenges involved with data-driven dosage techniques. To do this, a test interface was developed and several medical doctors of varying disciplines attempted to use it. You can view the interface <a href="https://hepstack-stage.herokuapp.com/">online</a> or in <a href="#appendix-2-application-user-interface">Appendix 2</a>. The survey consisted of five patient cases developed by domain experts to cover multiple different use cases for heparin. A doctor would first agree to a research disclosure, then fill out a short questionnaire about their background and relevant experience (Figure ). Next an instruction page was displayed explaining the survey (Figure , ). Once the doctor read over the instructions and guidelines, they were presented with their first case which consists of some lab results and a short admission note (Figure ). It was their task to determine a potential infusion rate based on traditional heparin dosing guidelines that were available to them. After choosing an infusion rate, the optimal dose model was displayed (Figure ). Unlike the standalone calculator, the survey version of the graph does not present the weight-only model. It does, however, plot the user's initial infusion rate on the estimated therapeutic curve as a black dot, so they can visualize the estimated dose versus their own dose (Figure ). The doctor then had the option of either adjusting the dose or sticking with their initial dose. Whenever dosing the doctor was able to leave notes to explain their reasoning. This task then was repeated for the remaining four patients. After completing the test, there was a short follow-up questionnaire consisting of a few questions to gauge receptiveness to the tool and measure any change in confidence when using the tool. Additionally, participants were asked for other places they thought the tool could be used (Figure ). Due to financial and scope limitations, we could not compensate participants for their time taking the survey. As a result all volunteers were acquaintances or friend's of friends of the author.</p>

<h2 id="architecture-and-implementation"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Architecture and Implementation</h2>
<p>The survey was implemented using the same technological stack as the calculator (Angular.js and Bootstrap on the front-end, Python and Flask on the back-end). By utilizing a SPA (single page application) methodology we were able to quickly iterate and make many revisions. There were several candidate versions of the survey developed and tested with domain experts for feedback. One initial version had the user adjusting the heparin infusion rate over time, to more accurately simulate a patient's care (Figure ). This technique was not used in the final version because we did not want to introduce the challenge of generating lab results dynamically overtime as a function of heparin infusion rate, and the patient's current and past conditions. The final iteration does not require the simulation of patient lab results and allows for the most direct input of comments from doctors, instead of relying on proxy metrics such as time to complete cases that are similar too each other.</p>

<h1 id="survey-results"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Survey Results</h1>
<!--
After the introductory chapter, it seems fairly common to

introduces methodology used throughout the thesis.
-->
<!-- maybe add a little intro... short description of primary findings -->
<h2 id="primary-findings"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Primary Findings</h2>
<p>Participants adjusted their doses 72% of time after reviewing the model, which resulted in a higher probability of therapeutic outcome in 82% of the adjustments. Additionally, participants reported greater confidence when using the tool but also expressed some hesitation with adopting the tool, often due to a lack of understanding of the underlying models. More information follows. Access to the extended survey results can be found in <a href="#appendix-1-full-survey-results">Appendix 1</a>.</p>
<h2 id="participant-profiles"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Participant Profiles</h2>
<p>In total nine participants, all medical doctors, completed the survey. They range in experience from 4 to 32 years practicing. Of the nine, one participant is a practicing physician in Ethiopia, and the rest practice in the United States. One participant completed the study from a mobile device and the others from a traditional laptop or desktop computer. Five of the nine reported that they frequently prescribe heparin (at least once a week) in their current position. One participant reported prescribing it infrequently (once a month), two reported prescribing it rarely and one reported prescribing never. All participants reported that at sometime in the past they prescribed it frequently. The participant medical specialties can be found in Table , but ranged from hematopathology to neuroendovascular surgery. Although nine participants took the survey, one participant's (participant 9) infusion rates were disqualified from the data analysis because they were 100 times greater than the mean. The user is a practicing radiologist in the United States, who rarely prescribes heparin. Their comments in Table  note that they would like to see more feedback from the calculator.</p>
<!-- ## Cumulative Results -->
<!-- how many difference people took survey, specialties, time since last dosed heparin.  -->

<h2 id="dose-differences"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Dose Differences</h2>
<p>Each of the eight participants prescribed heparin twice to five different patients, yielding a total of 80 infusion rates. In Table , for each patient there is a suggested optimal infusion rate (IR) in the top header. This is the number that was displayed to the user after they entered their initial infusion rate <em>IR1</em>. <em>IR2</em> is the value they prescribed after viewing the optimal dosage curve and the suggested infusion rate.<br />
In the 40 trials, participants choose only 11 times to maintain their initial infusion rate. In other words, 72% of the time participants adjusted their dose after viewing the model's suggested dose. In five of the 29 times that a change was made, the change resulted in lower probability of a therapeutic outcome than the original dose. All five of these events occurred with participant number one, which may reflect the user struggling to understand how to use the tool. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this study, we cannot determine what an ideal dose should be, as many guidelines exist for recommending infusion rates, and there may exist multiple infusion rates that result yield therapeutic results.</p>
<!-- Did you test the idea of giving a bad estimate?? 
Would this encourage the doctor to make a bad judgement based on "trust"? -->
<!-- Is the model in question or the doctor usability? 
What is the ultimate goal of this tool? -->
<!-- In addition to correlation of the model to actual doses, 
what is the maximum error? -->
<p>As for the reasoning for adjusting doses, they vary greatly as can be seen in the appendix in Table . Those who choose to adjust towards the model values generally expressed trust in the model, while some users, in particularly those who currently prescribe heparin frequently were more wary of it. Some users explained they wanted to adjust the infusion rate based on features that were not considered in the model. Others expressed they wanted to adjust dosage using the Anti-Xa Assay (an assay designed to monitor anticoagulant therapy <span class="citation">(Reka G Szigeti 2014)</span>.) Additionally, others expressed that their initial dose was close enough, and that they preferred round numbers, since administering doses in non-integer units is not always possible. These results break down into two points of consideration. One is the user's lack of faith in the model, which is understandable considering it is not yet mature. The other set of concerns are perceived faults in the model, which come from a lack of understanding. This indicates an issue with usability and the communication of the model to the user.</p>
<h2 id="user-feedback"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> User Feedback</h2>
<p>Eight of the nine participants reported they felt more confident dosing with the tool than without. One participant said it did not affect their confidence. Although in general users reported greater confidence with the tool, the majority expressed concern with adopting it due to a lack of understanding of the models. As one participant noted the models are &quot;a bit of a 'black box'.&quot; Other users noted that they were concerned the tool was not adjusting for some specific complications. Another user noted they were concerned about adopting it given there has not been a validation trial for the technique. These concerns and others will be addressed in the following section.</p>

<h1 id="retrospective-and-next-steps"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Retrospective and Next Steps</h1>
<!--
After the introductory chapter, it seems fairly common to 
include a chapter that reviews the literature and 
introduces methodology used throughout the thesis.
-->
<h2 id="user-concerns"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> User Concerns</h2>
<p>Although most participants expressed that the dosing tool gave them greater confidence, the majority also had reservations with adopting the tool in their practice. Their common concern involved their understanding of how the tool worked. This concern is appropriate, as it reflects a conservative approach to experimenting on best practices in patient care. One reason for their lack of understanding can be attributed to the nature of this study, in that participants completed the survey on their own time and were given no incentives for completing the survey. As such, many users may have read the system explanation quickly.<br />
Additionally, the technique used for dosing, although not terribly complex, is not trivial to understand. Physicians in general cannot be asked to learn how a logistic regression works or how these models are built. Simply speaking, their time is very valuable and limited. Thus, experimental techniques need to be validated in formal clinical setting with physicians who are invested in understanding and participating in a trial of the new tools. Then once the techniques are validated others can adopt them with greater confidence.<br />
Another concern expressed was that the tool did not consider other potential features when dosing patients. Although these features can be added overtime, as the data becomes available and coded appropriately, this concern speaks to the greater issue of user interaction with the model. In its current state, the standalone calculator allows physicians to view the weight-only model and the all-features model (age, SOFA score, creatinine level, ethnicity, gender, etc.) This gives them a better understanding of how these features change the therapeutic curve. Future versions of this tool should allow the user to enable and disable a given feature, so they can have a better understanding of the effects of the feature on the model outcome. This understanding could potentially come in the form of additional visualizations like the original graph or arguably better in the form of written descriptions, e.g. &quot;The SOFA score causes a deviation of 3% from normal dosing.&quot; An initial version of this project included a crude nearest-neighbor visualization, but that feature was not incorporated in the final version due to time limitations. Increasing user interaction with the tool will hopefully address some knowledge and trust issues with the current system.</p>
<h2 id="shortcomings-in-the-survey"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Shortcomings in the Survey</h2>
<p>This study has no shortage of problems. The problems generally come from a lack of resources, in terms of time and money. A funded study would allow for a greater number of participants with specific ICU expertise. Additionally, the participant selection process would not be limited to friends of the researchers, which may have skewed the results. Funding would also allow for time for researchers to work with participants to better understand the model. Given the problems with the survey, and limited number of participants, the results are still very valuable as they clearly reveal areas for future improvement in the system.<br />
One place for future research would be creating a similar survey that periodically provides sub-par dosage estimates for doctors. Then one could measure how frequently doctors correct the estimate. If doctors do not consistently catch dosing errors, that would indicate that increased dose validation software should be implemented.</p>
<!-- ## Places for Future Research -->
<!-- how did the doses differ in part 1 and part 2 of the survey.  -->
<h2 id="future-implementations"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Future Implementations</h2>
<p>The experimental nature of this project has lead to a software implementation that is limited in several ways. The codebase served its purpose as a tool for a research study fairly well, but it is not &quot;real world&quot; ready in its current form. In future versions we'd like to see improved logging, system documentation, automated unit testing on builds, and better scaling performance. Additionally, the overall design should be more modular, such that it is easier to try out and compare different candidate models (e.g. Ensemble Learning, Neural Networks, SVMs, etc.) on different drugs. Automated testing could even run trial comparisons and compute statistics on models. From a data processing perspective, an entire subsystem should be designed and built for selecting data from the medical records database and translating it into a suitable form for models. There should also be tools for validating the cohort selection. This is not a trivial task when working with a specific medical record database, and becomes much more challenging when attempting to interface with other databases. Defining the generic interface used for selecting the cohort from the database will be challenging. Finally, the data will also need to be validated and then translated (coded) to appropriate values for a given model.<br />
On the front-end, user analytics could be improved, as it would be ideal to know more about the user's device and how they interact on a per-click basis. One final improvement on the client would be modifying the data model, such that instead of requesting an estimate for a specific patient, the client requests a static model that has been precomputed on the server using the latest dataset. Then the user can manually modify features and the estimated probability curves are computed client side. This should allow for a much more responsive experience for the user, providing them instantaneous feedback for each feature change made, instead requiring a request to the server for each change. The dosage curves could be computed in a separate thread using web workers. Additionally, by implementing the predictions client side, patient data does not need to be transfered to an external server (easing HIPAA compliance), and the client can be fully functional offline which is ideal for low resource environments such as developing countries.</p>

<p>The central focus of this study was to implement an interactive data-driven dosage tool and test its usability with medical doctors. While doing this, we learned about domain specific, technical, and usability challenges. The goal of our work was to provide sufficient information such that a new version could be built and tested in a formal clinical setting. While the majority of participants felt more confident prescribing heparin using the tool, they also overwhelmingly expressed a need for a greater understanding of the underlying models making the predictions. This speaks to a usability problem that will be addressed in future versions by creating a more interactive, learning based tool. The future architecture will also open the door to dosing other drugs and trying out other models beyond logistic regression. These techniques will provide personalized insight in complex cases involving unique patient cohorts. Without question, in time, the computer's roll in prescribing drugs will grow, leading to improved quality of care for patients while decreasing hospital stay times and the cost of care.</p>
